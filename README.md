# enigma-6.py
This is very basic enigma with only 1 Rotor and 6 letters python code. I've used Pygame library to create friendly interface outisde the terminal. 
Feel free to download the project and expand for more letters.

Since there are only 6 letters, I decided to encode the word "FADE" and as the crypted messaged I recieved "DBDB", which according to the enigma's logic if we don't switch the rotos and put the crypted message in the input ("DBDB") we should obtain the original message >> "FADE", the hypotesis confirmed, therefore the code has been proven working correctly. 

Image of the step-by-step encoding attached with the visual interface.
